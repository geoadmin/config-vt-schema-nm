    rank:
      description: |
          Countries, states and the most important cities all have a
          **rank** to boost their importance on the map.
          The **rank** field for counries and states ranges from
          `1` to `6` while the **rank** field for cities ranges from
          `1` to `10` for the most important cities
          and continues from `10` serially based on the
          local importance of the city (derived from population and city class).
          You can use the **rank** to limit density of labels or improve
          the text hierarchy.
